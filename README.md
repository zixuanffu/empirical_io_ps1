# Empirical Industrial Organization Problem Set 1
## Demand Estimation for Differentiated Products 
In this assignment you have to estimate a simple version of a random-coeﬃcients model for car demand.
The objective of the assignment is to familiarize with these type of discrete choice models, to learn to
estimate non-linear models via GMM, and measure markups in diﬀerentiated products markets.
You can work in groups of 3 people, each group has to send a pdf report as well as the code ﬁles used
to generate the results.

When reporting results, present them in tables that are easy to read and discuss your ﬁndings. Do
not simply attach a printout of the computer program you used.

Deadline: Please send your problem set before November 4th, 2024.
