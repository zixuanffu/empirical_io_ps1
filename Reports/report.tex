\section{Data}
The dataset is a panel of aggregate (model level) car sales along with the
characteristics of each model. The data spans 1977-1981 in the U.S., giving
rise to 5 markets in total. We divide the quantity sold \verb|q| by the market
size (the number of households \verb|hh| in that year) to get the market share
for each model. We also adjust the car price \verb|p| by the consumer price
index \verb|cpi| to get the real price.
\begin{equation*}
    p_{adj} = \frac{100 \times p}{cpi}
\end{equation*}
We rescale the price by $p/1000$ to make the coefficient on price more readable. An overview of the mean and standard deviation of the variables is shown in Table \ref{tab:desc}.

\section{Logit Model}
\subsection{Utility function}
The standard utility function takes the following linear in characteristics
form:
\begin{equation}
    u_{ij}=X_{j}\beta + \alpha p_{j} + \xi_{j}+ \epsilon_{ij}=\delta_j+\epsilon_{ij}
\end{equation}
where $i$ represents individual and $j$ represents the product. $X_{j}$ includes the following variables: \verb|dpm, door3, door4, door5, at, ps, air, drv, wt, hp2wt, hp, euro, japna, size, wb, (brand dummies)|. We assume that $\epsilon_{ij}$ is distributed type I extreme value and is independent across all products $j$. Thus, the market share for each product is given by (by normalizing the utility of the outside good to zero)
\begin{equation*}
    s_j = \frac{e^{u_{ij}}}{1 + \sum_{k=1}^{J} e^{u_{ik}}}
\end{equation*}
Thus,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:logit}
    \log s_j - \log s_0 = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{j1} + \cdots + p_j \alpha + \xi_j
\end{equation}
where $\xi_j$ is the fixed effect/unobserved heterogeneity of each product $j$. For the remaining section, we assume that all characteristics except price are exogenous.

\subsection{Estimation}
The OLS estimation is unbiased and consistent if we assume that $\xi_j$ is
uncorrelated with $p$. We perform two OLS estimations based on equation
\eqref{eq:logit} with and without brand fixed effect. The results are shown in
Table \ref{tab:reg_logit}. However, it is generally not the case. Price is
generally correlated with unobserved characteristics. We construct instruments
based on \citet{berrylevinsohnpakes1995}. That is, for each product
characteristic $x^k$, we compute
\begin{itemize}
    \item $z^k_{j}=\sum_{k\in \mathcal{F}_j, j'\neq j}x^k_{j'}$, the sum of characteristics of all other products belonging to the same firm.
    \item $z^k_{j}=\sum_{k\notin \mathcal{F}_j}x^k_{j'}$, the sum of characteristics of all other products belonging to rival firms.
\end{itemize}
This is a measure of the competitive environment surrounding firms, capturing the substitutability of other available cars to any particular model.

Since we have many $x^k$, we have a large number of instruments. Following
\citet{berrylevinsohnpakes1995}, we selected the following to instrument price
$p$: \verb|const_*, dpm_*, hp2wt_*, size_*, air_*|. The IV estimation results
are shown in Table \ref{tab:reg_logit}.

\subsection{Results}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \fontsize{8pt}{10pt}\selectfont
    \centering
    \input{../Results/Tables/logit.tex}
    \caption{Logit estimation results}
    \label{tab:reg_logit}
\end{table}

We observe that the coefficient on price, $\alpha$, is larger (in absolute
terms) but noisily estimated using IV compared to OLS. This makes sense as the
simple OLS regression yields downward-biased estimates (in terms of magnitude)
because failing to account for endogeneity underestimates the effect of price
on market share.

\section{Nested Logit Model}
\subsection{Utility function}
We relax the assumption that $\varepsilon_{ij}$ is independent across $j$.
Instead, we group the products into nests based on their size. The 3 nests are
\verb|compact, midsize, large| plus one outside option. Now the utility
function is given by
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        u_{ij} & =X_{j}\beta + \alpha p_{j} + \xi_{j} + \eta_{ig} + \epsilon_{ij} \\
               & =\delta_j + \eta_{ig} + (1 - \sigma)\epsilon_{ij}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
Following the derivation in \citet{berry1994estimating}, the estimation equation is
\begin{equation}
    \log(s_j) - \log(s_0) = x_j\beta + p_j\alpha + \sigma\log(\bar{s}_{j|g}) + \xi_j
\end{equation}

\subsection{Estimation}
In addition to $p$, $\log(\bar{s}_{j|g})$ is also endogenous. We follow
\citet{berry1994estimating} to construct additional instruments for
$\log(\bar{s}_{j|g})$, which is the sum of product characteristics of the rival
firms in the same nest $g$. We exploit the competition posed by rivals with the
added feature of this `competition' coming from within the same group (i.e.
size category). The results from demand estimation are presented in Table
\ref{tab:reg_nested_logit}.

\subsection{Results}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \fontsize{8pt}{10pt}\selectfont
    \centering
    \input{../Results/Tables/nested_logit.tex}
    \caption{Nested Logit estimation results}
    \label{tab:reg_nested_logit}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Price $\alpha$} Once again, the OLS estimates of $\alpha$ are biased towards zero. The OLS
estimation is upward biased.

\paragraph{Within nest substitutability $\hat{\sigma}$} The estimate of $\sigma$ is smaller in IV than in OLS, suggesting a lower degree of intra-group substitutability once we have accounted for the endogeneity of prices and within-group shares.

\paragraph{Instrument test}
%Zixuan:
The F-test of the first stage is a weak instrument test. The null hypothesis is
that the instruments are weak, which is rejected by the test, implying that our
instruments are not too weak. The Sargan-Hansen test is a test of
over-identification. The null hypothesis is that all instruments are valid,
which is rejected by the test, implying that some instruments are not suitable.

%Anoosheh:
From the results of the test of overidentifying restrictions, we are able to
reject the null that \textit{all} instruments are valid. Our instruments also
appear to be weak as indicated by the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) test
for weak IV-robustness (for an over-identified system). We cannot reject the
joint null of $H_0: \alpha=0, \; \sigma=0$. \\ This could point to a possible
failure of the exogeneity of the instruments we use.

\section{Random Coefficients Model}
\subsection{Utility function}
Next, we turn to our final specification of a random-coefficients model \`a la
\citet{berrylevinsohnpakes1995} where indirect utility is defined as
\begin{equation}
    u_{ij}=X_{j}\beta + \alpha p_{j} + \xi_{j} + \eta_i\text{size}_j + \epsilon_{ij} = \delta_j + \eta_i\text{size}_j + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{equation}
where $\eta_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$.
The difference here is that the coefficient $\eta_i$ is allowed to vary across
households $i$. After refactoring the indirect utility, we arrive at the
following expression, where the last line arises since we have learned that
$\bar{\eta}$ is zero. So that, even if the $\epsilon_{ij}$'s are still i.i.d.
TIEV across $j$, the composite error is not.

Now, the aggregate market share becomes
\[
    s_j = \int \frac{\exp{(\delta_j + \eta_i \text{Size}_j)}}{1 + \sum_{j^{\prime}}^{J} \exp{(\delta_{j^{\prime}} + \eta_i \text{Size}_{j^{\prime}})}} dF(\eta_i)
\]

\subsection{Estimation}
Unlike before, the relationship between $\log(s_j)$ and $\delta_j$ is no longer
as explicit. We need to find a way to recover $\delta_j$ from the observed
market share $s_j$. We follow the method provided by
\citet{berrylevinsohnpakes1995}. The procedure involves several steps,
including drawing values from a normal distribution, contraction mapping, and
GMM estimation.

The procedure is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We draw 500 values from a normal distribution $N(0,1)$.
    \item We pick an initial value of $\sigma$.
    \item Given a value of $\sigma$, we calculate the predicted market share based on
          $\sigma$ by approximate the following integral
          \begin{equation*}
              s_j(\delta_1,\ldots,\delta_j)=\int \frac{e^{\delta_j+\eta_i\text{size}_j}}{1+\sum_{k=1}^{J}e^{\delta_k+\eta_i\text{size}_k}}dF(\eta_i)
          \end{equation*}
    \item We use contraction mapping to find the value of $\delta$ vector that makes the
          predicted market share equal to the observed market share.
    \item Once we have the $\delta$ vector which is linear in $X$.
          \begin{equation*}
              \delta_j=X_j\beta+\alpha p_j+\xi_j
          \end{equation*}
          We can estimate the $\beta$ and $\alpha$ with some instruments, thus getting the residual $\xi_j$.
    \item We compute the empirical moment condition is $Q(\sigma)=Z'\xi$ where $Z$ is the
          instruments and $\xi$ is the residual, which is of dimension $ \# \text{instr}
              \times 1$. The GMM objective function is thus $Q(\sigma)'WQ(\sigma)$.
          \begin{equation*}
              \min_{\sigma} Q(\sigma)'WQ(\sigma)
          \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

Note that by creating nests, we create a new endogenous variable
$\log(\bar{s}_{j|g})$ for which we create new instruments. Similarly, by
creating a random coefficient term $\eta_i$ on size, we create extra
endogeneity. (How so?) We follow \citet{gandhihoude2019measuring} to construct
extra differentiation instrument.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Quadratic: $\sum_{j' \neq j} (d_{j'j}^k)^2$ where $d_{j'j}^k$ is the distance
          between product $j$ and $j'$ in characteristic $k$.
    \item Local: $\sum_{j' \neq j} 1\{d_{j'j}^k < sd^k\}$ where $sd^k$ is the standard
          deviation of $x^k$ acorss all markets.
\end{enumerate}
We select the following instruments in addition to the previous nested logit
instruments: \verb|size_local, disp_local, wb_local, hp_local, hp2wt_local|.

\subsection{Results}
We plot the GMM objective function w.r.t. $\sigma$ in Figure
\ref{fig:iv_local_diff}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../Results/Figures/gmm_obj_iv_local.pdf}
    \caption{GMM objective function w.r.t. $\sigma$}
    \label{fig:iv_local_diff}
\end{figure}

The sigma that minimizes the GMM objective function is 2.3. Given the
$\hat{\sigma}$, we recover the mean utility $\delta_j$ for each product in
every market. The estimation results by regressing $\delta_j$ on $X_j$ and
$p_j$ are shown in Table \ref{tab:reg_rand_coef}.

\section{Markups and Merger Simulation}
\subsection{Price setting equation}
The profit of a multiproduct firm is
\begin{equation*}
    \Pi_f = \sum_{j\in \mathcal{J}_f} (p_j - c_j) s_j M
\end{equation*}
since $s_j M$ represents the sales of product $j$. The optimal price is given by taking the first order derivative with respect to $p$:
\begin{equation*}
    s_j + \sum_{k\in \mathcal{J}_f} \frac{\partial s_k}{\partial p_j} (p_k - c_k) = 0 \quad \forall j \in \mathcal{J}_f
\end{equation*}
The first term is the direct impact of changing $p_j$. The second term is the
impact on the profits of other products of the firm.
For firm $f$, the pricing equation written in matrix form gives:
\begin{equation*}
    S^f + \Omega^f (P^f - C^f) = 0
\end{equation*}
where $\Omega^f$ is the matrix of cross-price elasticities.
For example, if firm $f$ has two products, the matrix is $$
    \Omega^f =\begin{bmatrix}
        \frac{\partial s_1}{\partial p_1} & \frac{\partial s_1}{\partial p_2} & 0 \\\ \frac{\partial s_2}{\partial p_1} &\frac{\partial s_2}{\partial p_2} & 0 \\0 & 0 &0\\
    \end{bmatrix}$$
Therefore, aggregate the pricing equation for all firms, we have $$ S + \Omega
    \odot O (P-C) = 0 $$ where $O$ is the ownership matrix.
We take $\hat{\alpha} = -0.087$. We estimate marginal cost (negative), markup,
and elasticity for each year. We simulate a merger between firm 17 and firm 7
by modifying the ownership matrix. The mean results are shown in Table
\ref{tab:post_merger_mean}.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \fontsize{10pt}{12pt}\selectfont
    \centering
    \input{../Results/Tables/post_merger_mean.tex}
    \caption{Markup}
    \label{tab:post_merger_mean}
\end{table}
The anomaly is that we get
negative marginal cost, this is due to the small $\hat{\alpha}$ from the
estimation. Also, the effect of average price seems to be very insignificant.

\subsection{Estimation}
We calculate consumer surplus pre- and post-merger in monetary terms:
\begin{equation*}
    CS_i = E(\max_j u_{ij}) = \frac{\ln(1 + \sum_j \exp(\delta_j + \mu_{ij}))}{\alpha_i}
\end{equation*}
Thus in total:
\begin{equation*}
    CS = M \int CS_i(\theta) dF(\theta)
\end{equation*}

The result is shown in Table \ref{tab:post_merger_cs}.
